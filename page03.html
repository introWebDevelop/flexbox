			<p>We don't know for certain what will happen in the future. Many people believe that AI won't necessarily take over everyone's jobs but it will be used as tool that will help improve work experience. Which may lead to a surge in AI jobs and increased demand in AI skills. And their are many jobs such as therapists and counselors, social work and community outreach roles, musicians, judges, etc that AI will most likely not replace. But jobs in office support, customer service and sales, food services, and production will be replaced by AI in the near future.</p>
