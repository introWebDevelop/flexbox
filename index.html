			<p>AI or otherwise known as Artifical intelligence is the science of creating machines that can think like humans. The first person to ever start working in the field of Artifical Intelligence was Alan Mathison Turing, a British logician and computer pioneer in the mid-20th century. Computer programmers and scientists developed AI by taking in a huge chunks of data, inputing it into the computer where it can process the data, and learn from the past actions in order to make comprehensive decisions in the future. AI was created to provide human-like interactions with software, develop systems that can analyze large datasets, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions. </p>

			<h3 class="subTitle">Why is AI such a big deal?</h3>
			<p>The reason why AI is such a big deal now is because of increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage.
